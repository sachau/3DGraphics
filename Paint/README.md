The user experience in this program would be that the program allows for the user to draw three shapes by clicking on their respective buttons. Clicking on one of the buttons with a shape will draw the shape while the two other buttons would either redo the last action or clear all the shapes on the screen. The Window also has three buttons that does the typical action of minimizing, full screening, or exiting the window. 
### Circle Button
The circle button will draw a circle in a random location when clicked on by the user. 
### Triangle Button 
The triangle button will draw a triangle in a random location when clicked on by the user. 
### Square Button
The square button will draw a square in a random location when clicked on by the user. 
### Redo Button
The redo button will redo the last action done by the user. It can only redo one action and then it is un-clickable. 
### Clear All Button
The clear all button will clear the window of all the shapes that were drawn by the user. 
### Window Screen 
The screen to show the shapes will be a set size unless the user wants to enter full screen mode. 
### Minimize Button
The minimize button will minimize the screen.
### Full Screen Button
The full screen button will make the window screen the size of the monitor.
### Exit Button
The exit button will cancel the program and close the screen.

At startup, the program will create all the buttons and assign a certain even to each button. The event will occur when clicked on. The event will either be drawing a shape, redoing an action, or clearing the screen. The user also has the option of minimizing, full screening, and exiting the screen. After each event, it will wait and listen to the next action except if the user clicks on the exit button. If the user clicks on the exit button, the program will end and close.
